// Self-reported boards (docs/api-rounds.md), one per pack that has one (public/packs.js BOARDS): after a quick round in
// the AI pack a player can say which lab they are with (POST /api/round/lab, GET /api/labs), after one in the Politics
// pack which side they are on (POST /api/round/party, GET /api/parties). Self-reported and anonymous: one claim per round
// with its board, the play's day, the round's difficulty and the stored play's score and overconfidence (migrations
// 0008, 0009). Bounded: a claim reads the round and its play by key, then one batch writes the claim and two lab_agg rows
// and reads the board; the board sums lab_agg (at most 6 sides x 3 difficulties a day), never lab_claims.
