// Rounds (docs/api-rounds.md): ten two-choice questions per round, quadratic points, calibration types, challenge links,
// the Slack/Discord daily question, pair flags. Pairs and ranked days come in as data from loadRounds (unit tests use
// fixtures; _rounds_data.js loads the bundled copies). Request functions return {status, body}.

// round_agg rows; a dare's complete counts that round's plays) and aggregates in SQL. The exception is retiring a pair: the affected ranked days are recomputed
// in SQL from their answers (once per retired pair).
