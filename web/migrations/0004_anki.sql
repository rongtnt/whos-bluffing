-- HowSure for Anki v0.2: opt-in anonymous rating uploads (POST /api/anki/submit, /api/anki/delete, GET /api/anki/stats).
-- Request paths touch only the request's own rows, the install's anki_installs row and two anki_agg rows; nothing on a
-- request path scans anki_rows.

-- One row per installation id (the add-on's local salt hashed again; the salt never leaves the computer).
-- rows = ratings currently stored for the install. A deleted install keeps only its id and deleted_at, so a later
-- upload from it gets 410.

-- One row per uploaded rating, idempotent on (install_id, row_id). row_id is the add-on's local sequence number.
-- WITHOUT ROWID: the primary key is the table, so each insert or delete writes one row instead of two.
