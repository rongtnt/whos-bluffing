"""Comparison pairs for Who's Bluffing rounds (items/pairs.json) and the daily ranked rounds and chat questions
(daily/rounds.json). Python 3.9+, standard library only. From the repo root:

    python3 analysis/items_pipeline/pairs.py

Pairs: two items of items/pool.json with the same category and unit; the larger value is at least 1.3 times the
smaller (melting points compared in kelvin), or, for years, at least 10 years apart ("Which came first?"). The AI pack's
categories (items/ai_curated.json: ai_timeline, ai_drama, ai_released, ai_company_founded, ai_money, ai_params, ai_tech)
need only 2 years, 3 months (timeline) or 2 months (drama) (MIN_GAPS, written to each template as `min_gap`; money and
tech use the 1.3 ratio), their year
difficulty scales to match (easy >= 10 years, medium >= 4), their tier 1-2 items count as
famous (`famous`), and they stay out of ranked rounds and the chat question (QUICK_ONLY). AI items carry a `tier` (1 famous
names and years, 2 events and money, 3 technical); a pair's tier is the higher of its two, and the AI pack draws by it
(web/public/packs.js). ai_money items are `volatile` (dated figures): paired for quick rounds, never ranked. The Politics
pack (items/politics_curated.json: pol_elected, pol_timeline, pol_drama, pol_money, pol_numbers) follows the same rules
(2 years, 3 or 2 months, money and counts 1.3), never takes a ranked slot, and pol_numbers pairs any unit (OPEN_UNIT).
Left out: city populations, volatile items, retired items (`retired_at` in the pool, or daily/runtime.json, an export of
items_runtime), the disputed items in DISPUTED, and countries under 20,000 monthly views (famous countries only). An item
marked `ranked_ok: false` (fact-checked, but its definition or figure is ambiguous) is paired for quick rounds and its
pairs carry `ranked_ok: false`: never in a ranked round or the chat question. Difficulty from the ratio:
>= 3 easy, 1.6-3 medium, 1.3-1.6 hard; for years from the gap: >= 50 easy, 20-49 medium, 10-19 hard. No item is in more
than 25 pairs. A pair's number (`p00042`) and a/b order never change once given: live answers, challenge links and ranked
days store them. The number is persisted per (a_id, b_id, category, unit): a new pair gets `next_number`, a pair that
drops out (retired, or no longer picked) keeps its number in `absent` and gets it back if it returns, and no number is
ever reused. A new pair's order is a coin flip seeded by its two ids, so the correct answer is A about half the time. `ref_quality` is the
weaker item's (a fact-checked item counts as referenced). `fame` = the lesser of the two items' English Wikipedia
monthly views (`views_month`, pageviews.py): ranked rounds, the chat question and "easy" rounds need fame >= 50,000,
"normal" rounds >= 20,000; "brutal" rounds take any referenced pair. Selection fills each item's 25 slots in that order:
famous and referenced, famous, known (>= 20,000), referenced, the rest.

daily/rounds.json, one line per UTC day, today to today + 120, append-only (existing days are never changed):
{"ranked": [10 pair ids], "question": pair id}. Ranked: only `referenced` pairs, at most 2 per category, 3 easy +
4 medium + 3 hard, both items with >= 50,000 monthly views. Question: one more such pair (medium when possible) for the
Slack and Discord daily question, never one of that day's ranked pairs; a day's 11 pairs are about 22 different entities
(no "Mercury" twice through its diameter and its distance). No pair on two days within 180 days, no item on two days
within 25 (the brief asked for 30; the eligible supply cannot meet it). Days are filled one after another until one
cannot be: famous, referenced supply sets how far ahead the file reaches.
