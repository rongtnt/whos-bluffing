Ten comparison questions ("Which is longer: the Nile or the Danube?"). Pick one, then stake how sure you are, from 50% to 100%. The scoring rule pays for honesty: 50% scores nothing, 100% right is +100, 100% wrong is −300. At the end you get your type (Bluffer, Too sure, Spot on, Too modest or Playing it safe), a roast if you earned one, and a link to challenge a friend on the same ten.

## Play

- **Web**: [whosbluffing.com](https://whosbluffing.com). Unlimited ten-question rounds by topic and difficulty.
- **Discord**: one question a day in a channel, a private round with `/bluff play`. [Add it](https://whosbluffing.com/discord).
- **Slack**: the same, with `/bluff`. [Add it](https://whosbluffing.com/slack).
- **Classroom**: a live calibration curve for a class at [/class](https://whosbluffing.com/class). **Full assessment** (5 minutes) at [/test](https://whosbluffing.com/test).

## Why

Most people are surer than they are right. The game shows you by how much, every day, in a minute. It is also a pre-registered study ([prereg/PREREG.md](prereg/PREREG.md)): does daily feedback make people better calibrated? Anonymous answers are released under CC BY-NC 4.0 with a data card. No accounts, no tracking, no ads.

Questions combine sourced authored trivia with Wikidata comparisons. Every answer shows a source, and anyone can flag a question.
